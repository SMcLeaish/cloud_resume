# Accessing O'reilly books and courses for free with your military MWR account

This is the first post in a series on getting IT certs at no cost while in the Army. 

Part two will cover another free learning resource, the Air Force Digital University, which has been opened up for all DoD servicemembers. 

In part three I'll show step by step instructions to register to take a test at a Pearson Vue testing center using Credentialing Assistance. Pearson Vue is who you'll take tests through for Comptia, AWS, and Cisco, among many others.
