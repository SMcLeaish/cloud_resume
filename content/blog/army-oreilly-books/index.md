# Accessing O'Reilly books and courses for free with your military MWR account

- This is the first post in a series focused on acquiring IT certifications while strategically utilizing credentialing assistance during your military service.

I recently had an interaction with a service member who was looking to get training so he could take the Comptia Security+, which is a great certification to have as it fulfills a [DoD 8570 information assurance baseline](https://public.cyber.mil/wid/cwmp/dod-approved-8570-baseline-certifications/). I've seen this listed as a prerequisite for a lot of jobs. 

He wanted training so he could pass the certification. A search on the [Army COOL](https://www.cool.osd.mil/army/credential/index.html?cert=securityp3598) site for Security+ will bring you to a page with a number of training options available. However, none of these are free.

### Your Credentialing Assistance and Tuition Assistance caps out at $4000 per fiscal year *combined*.

If you're comfortable self studying, you can just use your credentialing assistance to take the test itself. I intend to go through the registration process step by step in the future. But for now, know that there are very good self-study resources available at *no cost* to the service member. 

### O'Reilly Media

As long as I've been interested in technology, O'Reilly books have been the go-to standard. Through a partnership with the MWR, service members can access a vast number of books and full courses on a ton of technology subjects via the O'Reilly learning platform. All you need to do to be able to use this resource is:

- Make an MWR library account. Go to the [online registration site](https://auth.dodmwrlibraries.org/?sid=soFpAqIntTouz5UfFrW2uAOCMOUOGIEPYoX-iyj1KHQ) and create your account. 

- Follow [these directions](https://army.dodmwrlibraries.org/oapp) to create an O'Reilly learning platform account. 

As far as specific study materials, I'm partial to the [Sybex](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/casp-comptia-advanced/9781119803164/) books, which are available through the learning platform. If you are using one of their books to study, you'll also get access to flashcards and practice tests through the [Wiley Efficient Learning App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wiley-efficient-learning/id1210057332). I used Sybex books to successfully study for and pass the CompTIA CySA+ and Pentest+. If you're more of a visual learner, as mentioned earlier there are full video courses offered by O'Reilly. I used one of their video courses to study for the CompTIA Linux+. All of this is at no cost to the service member. 

In conclusion, don't waste your CA/TA on training unless you absolutely need it. That is money that can be put toward completing a degree or other certifications!
